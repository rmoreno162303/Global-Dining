# Project #1
This project was designed as a project assignment for University of Texas at Austin bootcamp.

This is an application with the goal to show the travel needs of a user in select major cities for currency exchanges and local restaurants. A few interactive elements have been developed for the users engagement and ease of navigating the website. 

The first feature is on the homepage where the user is seeing a spinning globe which takes up most of the viewer space. Several pins are marking the select cities our application is currently tied to. Users have the choice of selecting the cities of Tokyo, Guadalajara, Lima and Paris. Once a pin has been clicked on it takes the user to an html page designed specifically for that city. 

The top of the page includes a header with a beautiful city image and a "back" button which will take the user back to the home page if they wish. Below this element we have 3 equally divided columns. The left column and middle column are meant for user engagement for the purposes of locating local restaurants and knowing the current exchange rate of currencies. All restaurants listed are clickable by the user and when interacted with are taken to the Tripadvisor page for the given restaurant. The currency exchange column in the middle is default set for USD to the currency of the destination selected. This can be changed by the user if they are from a different Country of origin and wish to use a different currency other than USD. The right column is a display of the Country's national flag and is non-interactive.

Below this we have a broad view of google maps of the city that the user selected on the home screen. This can be interacted with just as you would with your phone for zooming in and out of specific areas of interest. At the bottom of the page is a footer which is divided 3 ways horizontally with the other Country's that are currently in the applications development. Each picture of the Country listed can be clicked on by the user which will immediately take them to that destination page with all the elements above we have discussed for that location.
